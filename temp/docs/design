# Design Documentation for Service Router Operator

## Overview

The Service Router Operator is designed to manage the lifecycle of ServiceRouter custom resources in a Kubernetes cluster. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of services based on user-defined configurations.

## Goals

- Provide a robust and scalable solution for managing service routing in Kubernetes.
- Ensure high availability and reliability of services.
- Implement security best practices throughout the operator's architecture.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **Controller**: The core component responsible for reconciling the desired state of ServiceRouter resources with the actual state in the cluster. It watches for changes to ServiceRouter resources and takes appropriate actions.

2. **Admission Webhook**: Validates and mutates incoming requests for ServiceRouter resources. It ensures that only valid configurations are accepted and can modify requests to enforce best practices.

3. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Defines the schema for ServiceRouter resources, allowing users to create and manage these resources declaratively.

4. **Utilities**: A set of helper functions that assist with common operations, improving code reusability and maintainability.

## Go-Specific Coding Standards

- **Error Handling**: Always handle errors explicitly. Use `errors.Wrap` from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package for context-aware error handling.
- **Context Usage**: Pass `context.Context` through function calls to manage timeouts and cancellation signals effectively.

## Kubernetes Resource Handling Patterns

- Use the controller-runtime library to manage Kubernetes resources.
- Implement a reconciliation loop that follows the controller pattern, ensuring idempotency in resource management.
- Leverage informers and listers to efficiently watch and retrieve resources.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Cover all utility functions and controller logic with unit tests. Use the `testing` package and `gomock` for mocking dependencies.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions with Kubernetes API and ensure that the operator behaves correctly in a real cluster environment.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Validate the entire operator workflow, from creating a ServiceRouter resource to verifying the expected state in the cluster.

## Documentation Standards

- Maintain clear and concise documentation for all public APIs and components.
- Use Markdown format for all documentation files.
- Include examples and usage instructions in the user guide.

## Logging and Observability Practices

- Use structured logging with the `log` package to capture important events and errors.
- Integrate with observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to monitor the operator's performance and health.
- Ensure that logs contain sufficient context to facilitate debugging.

## CI/CD Pipeline Requirements

- Implement a CI pipeline that runs unit and integration tests on every pull request.
- Use GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments.
- Ensure that the release pipeline publishes the operator to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and updates the Helm charts.

## Code Review Criteria

- Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
- Verify that all new features are covered by tests.
- Check for proper error handling and context usage.
- Confirm that documentation is updated to reflect any changes made.

## Conclusion

This design document outlines the architecture, goals, and standards for the Service Router Operator. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to create a reliable and maintainable operator that meets the needs of our users.
